# Corruptify
⚠️This project is for developmental and educational purposes only

The "Corruptify" web application, built using Python and Flask, allows users to effortlessly generate corrupted files with customized attributes.
# Key features include:
✅ Custom Attribute Inputs: Users can specify the desired filename, select from various file extensions (e.g., txt, pdf, jpg), and set the file size in kilobytes.

✅ Dynamic Validation: To ensure data integrity, the "Warpify" application performs real-time validation. It prevents users from entering negative file sizes and provides immediate feedback by disabling the "Download" button and displaying error messages.

✅ Secure File Downloads: When all attributes are valid, users can click the "Download" button, and the application generates a corrupted file with the specified parameters. The file is then made available for download.

✅ Professional Presentation: The application's user interface is designed for a professional and modern appearance, creating a user-friendly experience. (It still has to be fine tuned)

Overall, "Corruptify" combines practical functionality with an attractive design, making it an excellent reference for web developers looking to build similar applications or enhance their projects.

# Work in progress:
🔃 I still need to host this on a web server possibly GitHub only...

🔃 I need to figure out a way to host this on a Raspberry Pi too seems like a more efficient option.

⚠️Please note that this project is just for educational and development purposes!
